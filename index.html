        Press <b>S</b> to shield the grenades.<br>
        <b>Shield rate</b> is how much of the time you're shielding while a grenade is pulled.
        <b>Success rate</b> is how many grenades you've been shielding successfully. <br>
        The goal is to keep the shield rate low, while keeping the success rate at 100%.<br>
        <br>
        Try to learn the timing at first, then play this mini game while doing something else (watch a movie, analyze a VOD, talk to someone, ...).
        You'll learn the timing of the grenades in no time.
